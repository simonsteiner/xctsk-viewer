# General Copilot Instructions

## 1. Simplicity First

- Do **not** add fallbacks, features, or configuration unless explicitly requested.
- Recommend best practices **only** when relevant and clearly optional.

## 2. Clarify Before Acting

- If requirements are ambiguous, **ask for clarification** before proceeding.

## 3. Prioritize Maintainability

- Keep code clean, minimal, and easy to understand.
- Use meaningful names; avoid over-engineering.

## 4. Manual Execution Assumed

- Assume all scripts/commands are run manually unless automation is **explicitly requested**.

## 5. Use Project Virtual Environment

- Always use the local Python environment `.venv/bin/python` instead of `python`.

## 6. Avoid Unnecessary Configuration

- Do not introduce complexity without clear need or request.

## 7. Comment Clearly

- Use concise comments to explain non-obvious logic or complex sections of code.
